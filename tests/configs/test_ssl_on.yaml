# Test configuration featuring SSL enabled at the root
# but disabled in one site.
#
# The disabled site's SSL setting should override the root
# setting for that site, while not affecting the other
# site.
#
# The hosts list should be empty, because:
# - Only one site is missing an `ssl` setting, so the site
#   inherits the root SSL value.
# - The site missing an `ssl` setting has one host declared,
#   with zero aliases. The site's sole host will be saved as
#   the 'main' host at the root. Had there been a host
#   declared on the config root `host` property, the host
#   list would not be empty.
