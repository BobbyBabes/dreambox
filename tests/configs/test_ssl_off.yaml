# Test configuration featuring SSL disabled at the root
# but enabled in one site.
#
# The enabed site's SSL setting should override the root
# setting for that site, while not affecting the other
# site.
#
# The root `ssl_enabled` setting, created by the Config
# class, should be set to true to reflect that there is
# at least one site whose SSL setting is enabled.
#
# The hosts list should be empty, because:
# - Only one site has SSL enabled.
# - The site with SSL enabled has one host declared, with
#   zero aliases. The site's sole host will be saved as
#   the 'main' host at the root. Had there been a host
#   declared on the config root `host` property, the host
#   list would not be empty.
