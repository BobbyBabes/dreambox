# Test configuration featuring multiple sites with full feature set
#
# The hosts list should contain only the first site's host,
# aliases and subdomains, because:
# - Only one site is missing an `ssl` setting, so the site
#   inherits the root SSL value.
# - There is a host declared on the config root `host`
#   property, so the site's host doesn't need to be repurposed
#   as the root host.
